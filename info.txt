<title>Top 10 Best Sites for Learning Chinese in 2025 | Lingflix</title>

<h1 class="entry-title title">Top 10 Best Sites for Learning Chinese in 2025</h1>
<div class="the_content"> <p> So you've made the choice to learn Mandarin Chinese. I made that same choice more than ten years ago, and it profoundly improved my life. This also means I've spent a decade experimenting with, abandoning, purchasing, canceling, enjoying, and disliking various Chinese learning tools. </p> <p> In this guide, I've gathered my top 10 favorite websites for learning Chinese. They have shown me that they are the best of the best—offering in-depth lessons, user-friendly interfaces, and high-quality learning tools. </p> <p> </p> <p> Download: This blog post is available as a convenient and portable PDF that you can take anywhere. Click here to get a copy. (Download) </p> <h2> 1. <a href="https://yoyochinese.com/"> Yoyo Chinese </a> <a href="https://yoyochinese.com/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> Yoyo Chinese has a special significance for me. I began using it when I was 13, and it's the resource that played the biggest role in advancing me from a beginner—around HSK 2—to an intermediate level, approximately HSK 4. </p> <p> Yoyo Chinese places a strong focus on conversational abilities and states that you can achieve a conversational level within six months. There are three primary courses—Beginner Conversational, Intermediate Conversational, and Upper Intermediate Conversational. Every course contains six levels, each with 7-10 units. These units are then composed of 3-5 video lessons. </p> <p> The videos typically last 5-10 minutes. At the intermediate stages, they are built around a conversation between native speakers. Yangyang—the founder—analyzes each line and introduces new vocabulary and grammar patterns from it. </p> <p> After watching the video, you can access an audio review, dialogue review, flashcards, and a quiz. Additionally, every lesson includes downloadable PDF notes. </p> <p> Besides the conversational courses, you can also find two Chinese character courses, a Chinese reader course, Chinese grammar series, and a "How to Say in Chinese" series. </p> <p> While I find the pricing reasonable—$14.99 monthly for basic and $19.99 for premium—the main drawback I should mention is that the free plan only provides access to roughly 75 videos. This is a small fraction compared to the thousands available on the site. So if you are on a tight budget, it might not be the right choice for you—at least not immediately. </p> <h2> 2. Lingflix </h2> <div> </div> <p> Lingflix enables you to learn from authentic videos by converting any YouTube or Netflix video into a language learning lesson. </p> <p> I started using Lingflix when I was around 16 years old—quite early in my Chinese learning journey, considering I'm 23 now—and I firmly believe it's one of the reasons my listening comprehension and natural vocabulary improved so rapidly. </p> <p> You get to hear how native speakers actually talk because the videos are made for them. However, what makes Lingflix so powerful is that you aren't just left to figure it out alone. Every video comes with interactive subtitles, allowing you to click on any unfamiliar word to instantly see its meaning, pronunciation, and example sentences in a pop-up. </p> <p> Clicking on the word also adds it to your personal flashcard deck, which uses a spaced repetition system to schedule your reviews for optimal long-term memory retention. After finishing a video, there is a quiz on the new vocabulary. The only potential issue is that the quizzes are quite detailed, so they might feel a bit demanding if you have a hectic schedule. </p> <p> There are also hundreds of curated videos already available on the platform that you can watch, sorted by proficiency level. Furthermore, the video-based dictionary helps you find videos that use the word you're searching for in context. </p> <h2> 3. <a href="https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/"> Mandarin Blueprint </a> <a href="https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> This is one of the most intensive Chinese courses I have ever tried in my entire ten years of learning. </p> <p> Mandarin Blueprint claims it can teach you Chinese up to five times faster using its distinctive immersion and Hanzi learning techniques. The creators assure that by the end of the course, you will understand 99.4% of Chinese, master 11,800 words, read and write 3,050 characters, and pass the HSK Level 9 exam. </p> <p> The course begins with comprehensive lessons on pronunciation. After that, it progresses to teaching characters using their "Hanzi Movie Method." </p> <p> It's a detailed mnemonic system that uses several lessons to guide you in creating your own, specific mnemonics for components, radicals, initial sounds, and ending sounds. When I was taking the course, I questioned if this was entirely necessary—but it absolutely worked. Once you learn the 105th character, you won't even need pinyin anymore. </p> <p> Once you've progressed through enough lessons and phases, the emphasis shifts to comprehensible input—native Chinese media suitable for your level. This is part of the "Mandarin Immersion Masterclass." There is an extensive Notion page filled with native speaker media, and the course guides you on exactly how to use each resource. </p> <p> The only disadvantage is the high cost. Specifically, $799. However, there is an option to pay in monthly installments of $39 for one year. The method is also very intensive—and not to mention quite unique—so if you don't have much time to commit to the course, it might not be a worthwhile investment. </p> <p> I wrote a comprehensive review of my experience with Mandarin Blueprint, which you can read here: </p> <div> <div> <div> Mandarin Blueprint Review: Can Get You Fluent, But at a High Price | Lingflix Language Learning Blog <p> Mandarin Blueprint is an extensive Chinese course that claims to teach you 99.4% of Mandarin. The creators also promise that you can pass the HSK Level 9 exam once you… </p> </div> </div> </div> <h2> 4. <a href="https://www.chineseclass101.com/"> ChineseClass101 </a> <a href="https://www.chineseclass101.com/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> ChineseClass101 has been a major player in the Chinese learning community for some time. </p> <p> When you sign up for ChineseClass101, you don't get a single, linear course. They teach using learner "pathways"—which are essentially collections of podcast and video lessons organized by specific themes and levels. For instance, the "Can Ask About Well-being" pathway includes seven video lessons with seven assessments spread throughout. </p> <p> Each lesson begins with the audio or video content. They are quite brief—about five minutes on average, in my experience. You then proceed to reviews and drills. The types of exercises vary depending on whether it's a grammar or vocabulary lesson. Lesson transcripts and downloadable PDF notes are also provided. </p> <p> Personally, I used ChineseClass101 as an additional resource to more structured ones like Yoyo Chinese. I appreciate the endless amount of content, but the lack of a clear structure made it challenging for me to use as a main resource. </p> <p> One feature I really like is the number of built-in study tools—such as flashcards and a personal word bank—and free bonuses they provide. There's a "word of the day" feature, a Chinese dictionary, free vocabulary lists, key phrase lists, and a list of the 2,000 most common Chinese words. </p> <p> If you choose the Premium Plus subscription, you also get access to the "My Teacher" feature. This includes the ability to message your tutor, live private classes, group classes, and an assessment test conducted by a tutor. </p> <p> Now, for the drawbacks. First, a free account offers very limited access. Second, the vast amount of content without a course-like structure can be overwhelming—it certainly was for me. Finally, there isn't a strong emphasis on reading or writing skills. </p> <p> Here's a more detailed review of ChineseClass101 if you are interested in it: </p> <div> <div> <div> My Complete ChineseClass101 Review: Great for Beginners, but Not Challenging Enough for Higher Levels | Lingflix Chinese Blog <p> Are the audio-based lessons of ChineseClass101 right for you? Click here to read my review of ChineseClass101 to find out. See the honest truth about the program’s… </p> </div> </div> </div> <h2> 5. <a href="https://mandarincorner.org/"> Mandarin Corner </a> <a href="https://mandarincorner.org/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> Mandarin Corner offers some of the most extensive free content I've encountered. They have a website and a YouTube channel featuring full video courses for HSK Levels 1 through 6, flashcard decks, podcast episodes and conversations, grammar lessons, and more. </p> <p> I used Mandarin Corner's HSK 4 video course. It contains 22 videos that teach all 600 words required to pass HSK 4, organized by parts of speech. For example, "Verbs 1-30," "Adjectives 1-30," etc. You learn about 30 words per lesson, and the videos are relatively short—averaging about 10 minutes. I really appreciated this. </p> <p> And the best part? All of Mandarin Corner's content is free. Honestly, this is the most comprehensive, high-quality resource I've found where paying anything is optional. </p> <p> But if you really enjoy their content and want extra materials like PDF notes and transcripts, you can upgrade to a premium plan with a one-time payment. Materials for an entire course cost between $15-40 (depending on the course size), and Anki flashcards are $10. </p> <p> You can also discover numerous reading and listening exercises on their YouTube channel. </p> <p> The only downside to Mandarin Corner is that it's entirely input-based—meaning you don't get any speaking practice. There are no quizzes either, so the only reinforcement you receive is through the flashcards. </p> <h2> 6. <a href="https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/"> Chinese Grammar Wiki </a> <a href="https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> Here is another free resource packed with quality information. Chinese Grammar Wiki has always been my primary reference for grammar explanations. </p> <p> They have over 2,100 free articles on Chinese grammar concepts, all organized by proficiency level. So it's entirely possible to use it as a grammar course by simply working through the articles sequentially. </p> <p> There are full courses—which are essentially lists of grammar points linking to the lesson articles—for HSK 1, HSK 2, and HSK 3. If you prefer CEFR levels, there are lessons up to C1. The leveling seems a bit unusual to me, but they state that the C1 grammar points correspond to HSK Levels 5-6. Based on my experience, it will take you to at least an upper-intermediate level. </p> <p> And if you prefer, you can purchase the lessons in an ebook (some levels also offer a paperback on Amazon) for as little as 99 cents. </p> <p> I love the structure and simplicity of the lessons. Each one begins with a summary that introduces the structure or formula of the grammar point. Then, it moves straight into examples. Even though the lessons are quite short, they are very thorough. I never felt the need to look up additional information after finishing one. </p> <p> The only minor complaint I have is the absence of pinyin. But for a free resource with so much content, I resorted to using a tool like Google Translate where I could copy and paste the sentence to get the pinyin when needed. </p> <p> Obviously, you can't use Chinese Grammar Wiki as your only—or even main—resource. It doesn't teach vocabulary or involve other skills. It's purely grammar. But if you combine it with a more comprehensive program like Lingflix or Yoyo Chinese, it's definitely worth using. </p> <h2> 7. <a href="https://www.lingodeer.com/home"> LingoDeer </a> <a href="https://www.lingodeer.com/home"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> LingoDeer is often considered the Duolingo for Asian languages. Many people told me that if I wanted to learn Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, I should use it instead of Duolingo. And they were correct. </p> <p> There are two Mandarin courses: Chinese I and Chinese II. Chinese I has four levels and Chinese II has six. </p> <p> The courses follow a set roadmap, so you must complete the units and lessons in order. The format is very similar to Duolingo—you start with multiple-choice translation options accompanied by pictures representing the word, and then proceed through several vocabulary drills. These include multiple choice, listening, translation, and matching exercises. </p> <p> Completing a lesson earns you points, and then you advance to the next lesson in the unit. </p> <p> One feature I appreciate is that each unit includes "Learning Tips," which function as mini grammar lessons. There's also a "Story" section, which is an interactive reading exercise available from the first lesson. Additionally, clicking "Vocabulary" displays all the words you've learned in the unit. </p> <p> However, I must point out that if you're not a fan of Duolingo, you probably won't enjoy LingoDeer either. It can feel rigid and the exercises may become repetitive. Personally, I don't like the inability to skip around in the course, and the progression feels somewhat slow. But if you have a busy schedule and are more likely to use your phone than a laptop, it might be more suitable for you than other options. </p> <p> If LingoDeer sounds like a program you'd be interested in, I recommend reading our full review here: </p> <div> <div> <div> Complete LingoDeer Review for 2024: Fun and Effective but Lacks Authentic Content and Video | Lingflix Language Learning Blog <p> My honest LingoDeer review for 2024 is based on trying to learn Japanese on LingoDeer in one week! I give all my honest impressions of the LingoDeer program and discuss… </p> </div> </div> </div> <h2> 8. <a href="https://www.italki.com/"> italki </a> <a href="https://www.italki.com/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> italki allows you to take one-on-one lessons with Chinese tutors within your budget. It's one of the most popular tutoring platforms, and I've been using it since I started learning Chinese. </p> <p> As of December 2024, there are over 900 tutors, and you can set filters to find the right one for your objectives—such as their country of origin, price range, lesson category (like grammar or conversation practice), etc. Each tutor has a video introduction and details of their class offerings on their profile. </p> <p> Once you've found someone you like, you can schedule 30-minute, 45-minute, or 60-minute lessons (some tutors even offer 90-minute sessions). If you get along well with the tutor, you can continue paying for classes individually or purchase a package of several lessons and schedule them in advance. </p> <p> I've taken almost every type of lesson on italki—I had one tutor who followed a textbook and taught me grammar in each class, but most focused on conversation practice. I would ask them to correct my mistakes, and they'd send me corrections and vocabulary I struggled with in the chat or a Google Doc. </p> <p> I enjoyed both lesson formats, and I suggest trying both to see what works for you. </p> <p> What distinguishes italki from other tutoring platforms is its "Community" feature. This lets you ask questions, practice Chinese writing, read articles published by italki tutors, and connect with other learners. I used this feature frequently for sentence corrections. Whenever I learned a new grammar concept, I would post my example sentences. I usually received corrections within a few hours. </p> <p> Finally, there is an option to take group classes that focus on specific topics (such as news, politics, daily life, reading clubs, etc.). </p> <p> The only real drawbacks to italki are that lesson costs can accumulate quickly if you don't set a budget, and the quality of lessons definitely varies from tutor to tutor. You will likely need to try a few different tutors before finding the right fit, which requires an investment of both time and money. </p> <p> There's really a lot to explore on italki. So if you want to learn more, you can read about my and another writer's experiences in our detailed review here: </p> <div> <div> <div> italki Review: Excellent for Finding Affordable, High-Quality Online Language Tutors | Lingflix Blog <p> Read this italki review to find out if this language tutoring platform will serve you well on your language learning journey! I’ll explain how it works, the pros and cons,… </p> </div> </div> </div> <h2> 9. <a href="https://www.pimsleur.com/"> Pimsleur </a> <a href="https://www.pimsleur.com/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> Pimsleur is an audio-focused course that uses a conversational listen-and-repeat format, setting it apart from all the other websites we've discussed so far. </p> <p> Each lesson starts with a conversation. Initially, you understand almost nothing. But by the end, you comprehend everything. </p> <p> The host instructs you to repeat after the native speaker at specific intervals to learn the new words used in the dialogue. So not only do you understand the conversation after 30 minutes, but you also gain a solid understanding of how to use the words and structures independently. </p> <p> Audio courses aren't for everyone, and I initially thought they weren't for me. But I came to love that the Pimsleur courses are almost entirely in Chinese and you start speaking within the first five minutes. So even if you don't use it as your primary resource, you immediately engage in listening and speaking practice. </p> <p> However, many people find the listen-and-repeat style becomes monotonous and repetitive after a few lessons. So keep that in mind. </p> <p> Each lesson is 30 minutes long, and there are 30 lessons in each level, so you can realistically finish one level per month. There are five levels in total. Based on my experience, these will bring you to a lower intermediate level—roughly HSK 3. </p> <p> Lastly, subscribing to the all-access membership provides you with study tools like flashcards and reading lessons. </p> <p> Pimsleur is another program we've reviewed in detail, so I highly recommend checking it out if you're considering using it: </p> <div> <div> <div> Pimsleur Review: Solid Audio Program, But It’s Not for Everyone | Lingflix Language Learning <p> Is Pimsleur’s popular, audio-based language learning program right for you? I’ve put together an in-depth Pimsleur review to help you decide. Discover the pros and cons of… </p> </div> </div> </div> <h2> 10. <a href="https://www.memrise.com/"> Memrise </a> <a href="https://www.memrise.com/"> <picture> <source/> </picture> </a> </h2> <p> Memrise has gone through many changes in recent years that haven't pleased everyone, but I still use it occasionally. And their community website has been a consistent part of my routine for years, which I'll discuss further later. </p> <p> The Memrise Chinese course consists of seven mini-courses representing different levels, starting at Absolute Beginner and ending at Mastery. Each mini-course contains five levels, except for Mastery, which has only one. There are 31 levels in total. </p> <p> Unlike many courses, Memrise doesn't follow a fixed structure. Instead, it offers "Scenarios"—groups of lessons that teach a specific topic. For example, there's an "Activities" scenario with six lessons like "Hobbies," "Going to the Cinema," "Making Plans," etc. </p> <p> As you complete lessons, you earn points. Once you accumulate 100 points, you progress to the next level. Since there's no set course structure, you can earn your 100 points from any of the Scenarios you choose. </p> <p> Memrise also incorporates videos featuring native speakers and conversations with AI chatbots throughout the lessons and tracks your completion progress. </p> <p> However, it's clear that Memrise is more of a vocabulary resource with very little grammar instruction. It's also somewhat more expensive than I believe it should be—$59.99 per month. </p> <p> I like that Memrise allows you to learn the vocabulary most relevant to you, and they've been creative with their practice exercises. But I wouldn't recommend it as your primary resource, and I honestly haven't used this newer version of Memrise extensively. </p> <p> What I have used consistently throughout my years of learning Mandarin is their community site. This is the older version of Memrise that lets you browse thousands of user-created courses and create your own. I've taken many HSK courses on this site, and I've created my own "courses" to study new vocabulary I learned from italki lessons. </p> <p> This is because the community site teaches you new words through various rounds of vocabulary drills like multiple choice and translation exercises. And it employs a spaced repetition algorithm to schedule your reviews for optimal retention. </p> <p> I co-wrote a more detailed Memrise review with another writer here if you'd like to learn more: </p> <div> <div> <div> Memrise Review: Lots of High-quality Language Courses, but Limited Free Content | Lingflix Language Learning <p> Can you master a foreign language with Memrise? In this review, we’ll investigate how the Memrise program teaches languages and whether it’s worth the cost of a… </p> </div> </div> </div> <p> </p> <p> I understand—searching for Chinese learning resources can be overwhelming. As you can see, I've been in that situation. But don't let analysis paralysis prevent you from getting started. </p> <p> These websites are what worked best for me. Select two or three, stick with the ones you prefer, and then drop the ones that don't suit your style. </p> <h2> Honorable Mentions </h2> <p> </p> <p> While the websites listed above are definitely my top choices, there are a few more I believe are worth mentioning: </p> <ul> <li> The Chairman’s Bao. This is an online, interactive newspaper in Mandarin Chinese. The articles are written specifically for Chinese learners and are labeled by HSK level. You can switch between simplified and traditional characters, and if you highlight a character or word, the definition and pinyin will appear next to the text. </li> <li> Rocket Languages. Rocket Languages is a comprehensive language learning tool, but its real strength lies in its audio lessons and pronunciation practice. These features will prepare you for real-life conversations with native Chinese speakers. The pronunciation tool allows you to concentrate on making your pronunciations sound more native, which is another significant advantage of Rocket Languages. You can learn more in this review . </li> <li> Chinese Boost Grammar Page. Chinese Boost’s grammar page is extremely detailed and is organized by level. They cover grammar topics from level A1 (absolute beginner) to level C1 (advanced). They also have topics arranged by HSK level. You can also select grammar lessons with specific characters or simply work through their list of tags, keywords, parts of speech, and functions. </li> <li> MandarinX. This collection of Mandarin MOOCs includes courses like Mandarin Chinese Level 1, Mandarin Chinese Level 2, Mandarin Chinese Level 3, Mandarin Chinese Essentials, Mandarin Communication, and Mandarin Chinese for Business. Each course is free and self-paced, meaning you work through the course on your own time without following a teacher's schedule or syllabus. And if you wish to receive a verified certificate at the end of the course, you only need to pay a small fee. </li> </ul> </div>

1)
Сейчас в выпадающий список языков отсортирован по имени файла картинки.
Нужно чтобы список был отсортирован по названию языка
2)
После надписи "68 Languages Available" надо вывести все изображения флагов



1)
в файле en/index.html есть строка:
<div class="feature-icon">🎥</div>
а также есть и другие картинки.
Разве не будет лучше вынести все файлы с картинками в assets?
Проследи за тем, чтобы в коде не было ни одной картинки. В коде должны быть только ссылки на картинки.

2)
вверху страницы сделай выбор языка сайта (выпадающий список с языками).
в выпадающем списке языков кроме названия языка должна быть картинка с флагом страны.
флаги стран также должны быть в assets.

3)
Желательно поправить ссылки на скриншоты так чтобы они ссылались на пути к скриншотам в зависимости от текущего языка.
Например сейчас в файле /en/index.html стоит такая ссылка:
<img src="../assets/images/screenshots/en/screenshot_00.png" alt="Lingflix Welcome Screen">
Но эта ссылка не будет меняться для файла /ru/index.html
Возможно есть смысл в строке "../assets/images/screenshots/en/screenshot_00.png" вместо "en" поставить язык страницы.
Посоветуй сам как лучше сделать. Желательно сделать так чтобы ссылки на. скриншоты были однотипными на всех страницах (для всех языков)

4)
при заходе на главную страницу сайта 
file:///Users/maximnikolaev/Documents/server_projects/site/index.html
он перекидывает меня на страницу
file:///ru/
А должен перекидывать на страницу
file:///Users/maximnikolaev/Documents/server_projects/site/ru/index.html

5)
Сейчас вкладка в браузере со страницей сайта не имеет иконки (в заголовке самой вкладки). Добавь иконку. Иконкой должен быть логотип приложения.

6)
я добавил файл /assets/images/common/logo.png
Но он появляется на долю секунды при загрузке страницы (вверху страницы перед надписью "Lingflix"), и сразу же исчезает.
Но при этом если закомментировать строку <script src="../assets/js/main.js"></script> - то картинка показывается нормально.

7)
Вот список кодов языков которые должен поддерживать сайт.
Измени эти коды если нужно. Я просто не знаю как они должны писаться корректно на сайте.
Если изменишь коды языков - выведи список измененных кодов.
